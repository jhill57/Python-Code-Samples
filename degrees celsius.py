#This program was written by Jordan on 2/2/20
# This program converts Farenheit to Celsius 
#You must have noticed the program doesn't run.
#Here is one way of coding it -- try this:
#degreesF = int(input("What is the temperature in Fahrenheit? "))

#degreesC = (degreesF - 32) * 5 / 9

#print("The temperature in Celsius is ", degreesC)


far = "degrees fahrenheit"
cel = "degrees celsius"
x = (far - 30)/2
print("x")
